  p When working on my first game, I've realised that it would require an immense effort in order to produce enough content for it. So I've focused on another, simpler concept.
  p Second game even got its name and a website: <a href="https://mylonglockingstory.online">"My Long Locking Story"</a>. I have even started the promotion activities by trying to get traction in Game Dev community in <a href="https://twitter.com/mlls_hq">Twitter</a> and on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mlls_hq/comments/dy7wdb/mlls_hq_has_been_created/">Reddit</a>.

  p Unfortunately, as it often happens with first-time founders, I've burned out due to endless work cycle and constant stress because of being "out of time".
  p This game features plenty of interesting code, such as a simple fluid simulation, a lot of force-based simulations, simple scripting runtime, dynamic dialog system, a level progression system with reactive unlockables, reputation system and much more.
