  p I was born in Mogilev, Belarus, moved to Vitebsk by the age of one, lived there until i was six and then spent 10 years in Dribin to later pursue my education and career in Minsk.
  p I had to move to Poland in 2021, where I currently reside.
  p Living on my own since the age of 16, spent good part of my childhood working on our family's farm 👨‍🌾.
  p As soon as my family got our first computer, I've spent countless hours messing with graphic and audio design software and tweaking the OS to my liking. Also, I've spent A LOT of time in video games 🎮.
